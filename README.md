## Hi, I'm Lakshmi! ⭐️
I'm a student, majoring in Data Science and AI. Currently, I’m pursuing undergraduate research in image generation. 

I have a passion for resposible AI and my core ambition is to build a career dedicated to contributing directly to the field of AI Safety! 
As I explore my interests, I'll be making some projects. You can find them here!
