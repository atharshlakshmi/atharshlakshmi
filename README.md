## Hi, I'm Lakshmi! ⭐️
I enjoy self-learning and taking on new challenges. Currently, I’m exploring different areas of Artificial Intelligence and pursuing undergraduate research in Image and Video Generation.

I've been joining hackathons to motivate myself to do more projects to apply my knowledge and learn new skills! You can find some of them here.
