## Welcome! ⭐️
Hi, I’m Lakshmi, and I'm majoring in Data Science & AI. Currently, I'm exploring the usage of video models to generate images as part of my undergraduate research. 

I have a passion for responsible AI and my core ambition is to build a career dedicated to contributing directly to the field of AI Safety! As I explore my interests, I'll be making some projects. You can find them here!
